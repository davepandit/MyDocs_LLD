### **Features Required:**

**1\. Document Creation:**

* **Functionality:** Users can create new documents with a title and optional metadata such as author name, creation date, and document tags.  
* **Data Schema:** Document schema includes fields for `title`, `content`, `metadata` (author, creation date, etc.), and `revision history`.

**2\. Real-Time Collaboration:**

* **Functionality:** Multiple users can edit the document simultaneously. Changes made by any user are immediately reflected across all connected clients.  
* **Implementation:** Use WebSocket connections for real-time updates and synchronization.

**3\. Version Control:**

* **Functionality:** Maintain a history of document revisions, allowing users to view, revert to, or compare previous versions.  
* **Data Schema:** Revision history includes version ID, timestamp, changes made, and author information.

**4\. Concurrency Management:**

* **Functionality:** Manage simultaneous edits by different users. Ensure document consistency and resolve conflicts as they occur.  
* **Implementation:** Use algorithms like Operational Transformation (OT) or Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to handle concurrent changes.

**5\. User Authentication:**

* **Functionality:** Users must log in to access and edit documents. Personalized access ensures secure and controlled document editing.  
* **Implementation:** Implement authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, JWT) to manage user sessions and permissions.

**6\. Document Sharing:**

* **Functionality:** Share documents with specific users or groups. Control access permissions (e.g., view-only, edit) based on user roles.  
* **Implementation:** Design access control lists (ACLs) and sharing settings within the document metadata.

**7\. Undo/Redo Functionality:**

* **Functionality:** Allow users to undo or redo recent changes within their editing session to correct mistakes or experiment with edits.  
* **Implementation:** Maintain a change log or stack for tracking and reverting changes.

**8\. Conflict Resolution:**

* **Functionality:** Automatically handle conflicts that arise from simultaneous edits. Provide tools or algorithms to resolve conflicts without user intervention.  
* **Implementation:** Use conflict resolution algorithms like OT or CRDTs. Optionally provide manual conflict resolution tools if needed

**9**.  **Autosave:**

* **Functionality:** Automatically save the document at regular intervals or after significant changes to prevent data loss.  
* **Implementation:** Implement periodic save operations and a mechanism to handle autosave triggers.

### **Data storage:**

The key challenges include:
1. **Data Schema**: Designing a structure to store the document's current content, metadata, and other relevant information.  
2. **Revision Management**: Creating a system to track changes made by different users over time, allowing for features such as version history, undo/redo, and conflict resolution.  
3. **Concurrency and Consistency**: Ensuring that the document remains consistent across all users, even when multiple edits are made concurrently.

### **Data structures used for tracking document changes and user sessions:**

**Primary Data Structure: `Revision`**

* **Purpose**: To store the details of each change made to a document.  

* **Attributes**:  
  * `id`: A unique identifier for each revision.  
  * `timestamp`: The time at which the change was made.  
  * `userId`: The ID of the user who made the change.  
  * `changes`: A detailed record of the specific changes made.  
  * `previousRevisionId`: A link to the previous revision, enabling us to trace back through the document's history
 
  * **Pseudo Code**:
  ```
  struct Revision {  
    int id;  
    string timestamp;  
    int userId;  
    string changes;  
    int previousRevisionId;
  }
  ```

  **Explanation**: The `Revision` structure holds all the necessary information about a single change to the document. By linking each revision to the previous one (`previousRevisionId`), we create a chain of revisions, allowing us to navigate backward and forward through the documentâ€™s history. This is crucial for supporting undo/redo operations.

**Secondary Data Structure: `Document`**

* **Purpose**: To represent the document itself and manage its revisions.  
* **Attributes**:  
  * `id`: Unique identifier for the document.  
  * `title`: The title of the document.  
  * `content`: The current content of the document.  
  * `revisions`: A vector of `Revision` objects representing the document's revision history.
 
```
struct Document {  
    int id;  
    string title;  
    string content;  
    vector<Revision> revisions;  
};
```

**Explanation**: The `Document` structure contains all revisions related to the document. Each time a user makes a change, a new `Revision` object is created and added to the `revisions` vector. This approach allows us to maintain a complete history of all changes, making it easy to access any previous state of the document.

#### **2\. Tracking User Sessions**

User sessions are critical for managing which users are currently editing the document, what changes they are making, and ensuring consistency in real-time collaboration.

**Primary Data Structure: `UserSession`**

* **Purpose**: To manage the state of each user's session while they are editing a document.  
* **Attributes**:  
  * `sessionId`: Unique identifier for the session.  
  * `userId`: The ID of the user.  
  * `documentId`: The ID of the document being edited.  
  * `isEditing`: A boolean to indicate whether the user is currently making changes.  
  * `lastActive`: Timestamp of the last activity to track session timeouts.
 


```
   struct UserSession {  
    int sessionId;  
    int userId;  
    int documentId;  
    bool isEditing;  
    string lastActive;  
  };
```
**Explanation**: The `UserSession` structure keeps track of important information for each userâ€™s session. This includes whether the user is actively editing the document and when they were last active. The `lastActive` field helps in managing session timeouts, ensuring that if a user becomes inactive, their session can be appropriately handled (e.g., by saving their work or notifying other collaborators).

**Secondary Data Structure: `SessionManager`**

* **Purpose**: To manage all active sessions.  
* **Attributes**:  
  * `sessions`: A map or hash table where the key is the `sessionId`, and the value is the `UserSession` object.

```
struct SessionManager {  
    map\<int, UserSession\> sessions;  
};
```
**Explanation**: The `SessionManager` structure is responsible for handling all active sessions. By using a map, we can quickly access any session by its `sessionId`. This data structure allows us to efficiently manage multiple users editing the same document simultaneously, ensuring that all their changes are tracked and conflicts are resolved.
