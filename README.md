### **Data structures used for tracking document changes and user sessions:**

**Primary Data Structure: `Revision`**

* **Purpose**: To store the details of each change made to a document.  

* **Attributes**:  
  * `id`: A unique identifier for each revision.  
  * `timestamp`: The time at which the change was made.  
  * `userId`: The ID of the user who made the change.  
  * `changes`: A detailed record of the specific changes made.  
  * `previousRevisionId`: A link to the previous revision, enabling us to trace back through the document's history
 
  * **Pseudo Code**:
  ```
  struct Revision {  
    int id;  
    string timestamp;  
    int userId;  
    string changes;  
    int previousRevisionId;
  }
  ```

  **Explanation**: The `Revision` structure holds all the necessary information about a single change to the document. By linking each revision to the previous one (`previousRevisionId`), we create a chain of revisions, allowing us to navigate backward and forward through the documentâ€™s history. This is crucial for supporting undo/redo operations.

**Secondary Data Structure: `Document`**

* **Purpose**: To represent the document itself and manage its revisions.  
* **Attributes**:  
  * `id`: Unique identifier for the document.  
  * `title`: The title of the document.  
  * `content`: The current content of the document.  
  * `revisions`: A vector of `Revision` objects representing the document's revision history.
 
```
struct Document {  
    int id;  
    string title;  
    string content;  
    vector<Revision> revisions;  
};
```

**Explanation**: The `Document` structure contains all revisions related to the document. Each time a user makes a change, a new `Revision` object is created and added to the `revisions` vector. This approach allows us to maintain a complete history of all changes, making it easy to access any previous state of the document.

#### **2\. Tracking User Sessions**

User sessions are critical for managing which users are currently editing the document, what changes they are making, and ensuring consistency in real-time collaboration.

**Primary Data Structure: `UserSession`**

* **Purpose**: To manage the state of each user's session while they are editing a document.  
* **Attributes**:  
  * `sessionId`: Unique identifier for the session.  
  * `userId`: The ID of the user.  
  * `documentId`: The ID of the document being edited.  
  * `isEditing`: A boolean to indicate whether the user is currently making changes.  
  * `lastActive`: Timestamp of the last activity to track session timeouts.
 


```
   struct UserSession {  
    int sessionId;  
    int userId;  
    int documentId;  
    bool isEditing;  
    string lastActive;  
  };
```
**Explanation**: The `UserSession` structure keeps track of important information for each userâ€™s session. This includes whether the user is actively editing the document and when they were last active. The `lastActive` field helps in managing session timeouts, ensuring that if a user becomes inactive, their session can be appropriately handled (e.g., by saving their work or notifying other collaborators).

**Secondary Data Structure: `SessionManager`**

* **Purpose**: To manage all active sessions.  
* **Attributes**:  
  * `sessions`: A map or hash table where the key is the `sessionId`, and the value is the `UserSession` object.

```
struct SessionManager {  
    map<int, UserSession> sessions;  
};
```
**Explanation**: The `SessionManager` structure is responsible for handling all active sessions. By using a map, we can quickly access any session by its `sessionId`. This data structure allows us to efficiently manage multiple users editing the same document simultaneously, ensuring that all their changes are tracked and conflicts are resolved.

### **Communication Protocol Between Clients and the Server**

#### **Overview**

The Real-Time Collaborative Document Editing System requires a robust communication protocol to ensure that multiple users can edit documents simultaneously with high consistency and responsiveness. The protocol leverages WebSocket connections to maintain real-time, bi-directional communication between clients and the server.

#### **Key Components**

1. **Client-Server Architecture**  
   * **Client**: The web application running in the user's browser. It captures user actions (such as text insertion, deletion, or cursor movement) and sends these actions to the server.  
   * **Server**: The server processes incoming actions from clients, updates the document state, and broadcasts these changes back to all connected clients.  
2. **WebSockets for Real-Time Communication**  
   * **Persistent Connection**: WebSockets provide a continuous connection, enabling instant communication between the client and server.  
   * **Event Handling**: User actions are transmitted as events (e.g., `textInsert`, `textDelete`) from the client to the server. The server then processes these events and broadcasts updates to other clients to maintain document synchronization.

#### **Steps in the Communication Process**

1. **Connection Establishment**  
   * The client initiates a WebSocket connection with the server upon opening a document. This connection remains active throughout the session, allowing real-time updates.

**Event Handling**

* **Client-Side**: When a user makes an edit, the client sends the corresponding event to the server via WebSocket.  
* **Server-Side**: The server processes the event, updates the document state, and broadcasts the update to all other clients.

**Synchronization**

* **Broadcasting**: After processing an event, the server broadcasts the updated document state to all connected clients.  
* **Conflict Resolution**: If conflicting changes occur, the server resolves these conflicts using predefined rules or operational transformation techniques.

**Disconnection and Reconnection**

* If the WebSocket connection is lost, the client attempts to reconnect automatically. Upon reconnection, the server ensures the client receives the latest document state.

#### **Error Handling**

1. **Event Processing Failures**  
   * If the server fails to process an event, it sends an error message back to the client, which then handles the error appropriately.  
2. **Connection Failures**  
   * The client should automatically attempt to reconnect if the WebSocket connection is lost.

### **How Multi-Threading Can Improve a Document Editing System**

**1\. Enhanced Performance:**

* **Parallel Processing:** Multi-threading enables parallel processing of different tasks. For instance, while one thread handles user input, another can handle document rendering or network communication. This leads to smoother and faster document editing.  
* **Efficient Resource Utilization:** By utilizing multiple CPU cores, multi-threading ensures that the system makes optimal use of available resources, reducing the time needed to process complex operations.

**2\. Improved Responsiveness:**

* **Non-Blocking UI:** Multi-threading allows for non-blocking user interfaces. For example, a separate thread can handle background tasks like saving changes or syncing with the server, preventing the UI from freezing or becoming unresponsive.  
* **Real-Time Updates:** In a collaborative environment, multi-threading can manage real-time updates efficiently. While one thread processes incoming changes from other users, another thread can update the local document view.

**3\. Enhanced Collaboration:**

* **Concurrency Control:** Multi-threading supports concurrent editing by multiple users. Threads can manage and resolve conflicts arising from simultaneous edits, ensuring that the document remains consistent and up-to-date.  
* **Background Synchronization:** Threads can handle background synchronization tasks, such as merging changes from different users or periodically saving drafts, ensuring that collaboration is seamless and continuous.

**4\. Scalability:**

* **Handling Multiple Users:** As the number of users increases, multi-threading can scale the systemâ€™s ability to handle multiple simultaneous actions. Each userâ€™s actions can be processed in separate threads, improving the system's overall scalability.
