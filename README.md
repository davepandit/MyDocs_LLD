### **Features Required:**

**1\. Document Creation:**

* **Functionality:** Users can create new documents with a title and optional metadata such as author name, creation date, and document tags.  
* **Data Schema:** Document schema includes fields for `title`, `content`, `metadata` (author, creation date, etc.), and `revision history`.

**2\. Real-Time Collaboration:**

* **Functionality:** Multiple users can edit the document simultaneously. Changes made by any user are immediately reflected across all connected clients.  
* **Implementation:** Use WebSocket connections for real-time updates and synchronization.

**3\. Version Control:**

* **Functionality:** Maintain a history of document revisions, allowing users to view, revert to, or compare previous versions.  
* **Data Schema:** Revision history includes version ID, timestamp, changes made, and author information.

**4\. Concurrency Management:**

* **Functionality:** Manage simultaneous edits by different users. Ensure document consistency and resolve conflicts as they occur.  
* **Implementation:** Use algorithms like Operational Transformation (OT) or Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to handle concurrent changes.

**5\. User Authentication:**

* **Functionality:** Users must log in to access and edit documents. Personalized access ensures secure and controlled document editing.  
* **Implementation:** Implement authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, JWT) to manage user sessions and permissions.

**6\. Document Sharing:**

* **Functionality:** Share documents with specific users or groups. Control access permissions (e.g., view-only, edit) based on user roles.  
* **Implementation:** Design access control lists (ACLs) and sharing settings within the document metadata.

**7\. Undo/Redo Functionality:**

* **Functionality:** Allow users to undo or redo recent changes within their editing session to correct mistakes or experiment with edits.  
* **Implementation:** Maintain a change log or stack for tracking and reverting changes.

**8\. Conflict Resolution:**

* **Functionality:** Automatically handle conflicts that arise from simultaneous edits. Provide tools or algorithms to resolve conflicts without user intervention.  
* **Implementation:** Use conflict resolution algorithms like OT or CRDTs. Optionally provide manual conflict resolution tools if needed

**9**.  **Autosave:**

* **Functionality:** Automatically save the document at regular intervals or after significant changes to prevent data loss.  
* **Implementation:** Implement periodic save operations and a mechanism to handle autosave triggers.

### **Data storage:**

The key challenges include:
1. **Data Schema**: Designing a structure to store the document's current content, metadata, and other relevant information.  
2. **Revision Management**: Creating a system to track changes made by different users over time, allowing for features such as version history, undo/redo, and conflict resolution.  
3. **Concurrency and Consistency**: Ensuring that the document remains consistent across all users, even when multiple edits are made concurrently.
